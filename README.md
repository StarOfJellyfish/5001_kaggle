# 5001_kaggle
#### HKUST20-21 BDT 5001_kaggle Assignment
#### Programming languages: python3. 
#### Required packages: 

```
import numpy as np
import os, sys
import math
import csv
import pandas as pd
from datetime import date
import holidays
```

#### How to run it: use jupyter notebook to run the kagglep.ipynb file and you will get a file named test.csv, which is the result of test dataset. 
#### About the files: the "train.csv" file provide the train dataset. the "test.csv" provide the data we need to pridict the speed of which. The "test.csv" is my final prediction of this problem.
#### Notes: I used the RandomForest (from sklearn) to predict the result of the speed of test dataset. Remembber to change the file reading path if you want to run it and make sure you have the required packages.
